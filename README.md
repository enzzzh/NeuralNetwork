#  My First Attempt at Making a Neural Network

##  Overview

This project was made in approximately **a fucklot of time** of coding in **C**. The neural network features a **self-training** mechanism, enabling it to refine its outputs automatically when errors are detected.

##  Features

- **Self-Training**: Automatically corrects mistakes through repeated learning.
- **Matrix Calculations**: Capable of executing complex matrix operations.
- **Function Limits**: Computes limits of mathematical functions effectively.

##  Getting Started

To begin, clone the repository and build it using your preferred C compiler:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enzzzh/neuralnetwork.git
cd neuralnetwork
```

##  Usage

Once set up, run the neural network by executing:

```bash
./neuralnetwork
```
